# drainData4APSIM
An example of how to compute annual tile nitrate loss from drain experiments and create APSIM-readable files 


I made this repo using data I downloaded from the [Sustainable Corn CAP research dataset](https://datateam.agron.iastate.edu/cscap/dl/). The `drainage.R`  calculates daily fluxes of nitrate-nitrogen in tile drainage from the raw data (see example below), and saves the output data as ".out" texfiles that can be read into the APSIM UI. Let me know if you have any questions.
